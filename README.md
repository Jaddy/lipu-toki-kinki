pali e lipu nimi pi toki kinki - creating a toki pona dictionary for kinky topics

[toki pona](https://tokipona.org/) is a nice and small [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) to think about things from a personal perspective, and also useful as a meta language.

This project aims at creating a dictionary of kinky (and queer) words and phrases. Language is mostly english and occasionaly german.

Feel free to copy, contribute, whatever.
