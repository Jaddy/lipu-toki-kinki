*pake* is an inofficial word, that was discussed between *pu* and *ku*. But since animals are not considered to really *understand* human language, this won't make much difference.

*pilin* (heart) and *luka* (hand) for left and right is a bit right-hand normative. Better suggestions welcome. *ku* suggests *poka* for left and *luka wawa* for right. While *poka* could work - just one word, distinctive sound, *luka wawa* has two words, which is not good for a command.
