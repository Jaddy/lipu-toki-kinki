# Toki Pona

Toki Pona is a language developed by linguist Sonja Lang, with only 137 words.

This side describes the entire grammar, the other side contains the entire vocabulary.

This version is based on v2 by jan Sa (Discord: Green Guy#5294), CC0. 

Original by [blinry](https://blinry.org/toki-pona-cheat-sheet/).

This version uses both *Toki Pona: The Language of Good* and *Toki Pona Dictionary* as its bases.

## Alphabet

Toki Pona uses these letters: `a e i j k l m n o p s t u w`

You can base them on their sounds in the IPA, but pronunciation doesn’t matter.

## Basic sentences

The particle *li* separates the subject from the predicate.

*soweli li moku* – The cat is eating.

*jan li lape* – Someone is sleeping.

There is no verb “to be.”

The part after *li* can be a noun or an adjective.

*kili li moku* – Fruits are food.

*telo li pona* – Water is good.

*telo li moku* – Water is a drink.

If the subject is *mi* or *sina* alone, the *li* is always omitted.

*mi moku* – I eat.

*sina pona* – You are good.

## Ambiguity

Toki Pona has ambiguity built into the language. You’ll need proper context to understand the intended meaning of a sentence. Verbs have no set tense.

*mi moku* – I am eating / I was eating / I will be eating.

Many words have multiple or general meanings.

*soweli* – cat / dog / (any land mammal)

*kili* - (any fruit or vegetable)

Most words can act as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs.

*telo* – water / wet / to wash

*pona* - good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly

Nouns have no singular/plural, and no definite/indefinite article:

*kili* – a fruit / the fruit / some fruits / the fruits

## Direct objects

The particle *e* separates a verb from its direct object.

*soweli li moku e telo* – The animal drinks the water.

*mi telo e soweli* – I wash the cat.

## Modifying words

Words can be modified by appending other words.

*jan lili* – small person, child

*tomo mi* – my house

*pilin pona* – a good feeling

To negate a word, append *ala*:

*mi lape ala* – I’m not sleeping.

*jan ala li toki* – No one is talking.

With multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word.

*lipu kasi tu* – two plant documents

*poki laso pimeja* – a blue and black box

You can change the way the modifiers interact using *pi*.

*lipu pi kasi tu* – a document of two plants

*poki pi laso pimeja* – a dark-blue box

## Prepositions

*kepeken*, *lon*, *sama*, *tan*, and *tawa* can act as prepositions. They go at the end of a sentence.

*mi moku kepeken ilo* – I eat with cutlery.

*soweli li lon tomo* – The animal is in the house.

*sina toki sama kala!* – You talk like a fish!

*mi kama tan esun* – I arrive from the store.

*ona li toki tawa sina* – They’re talking to you.

## “And”

There are many ways to say “and.” With subjects you use *en*.

*mi en sina li musi mute* – You and I are playing a lot.

With predicates you repeat *li*.

*soweli ni li lili li suwi* – This animal is small and cute.

With direct objects you repeat *e*.

*ona li jo e waso e kala* –She has a bird and a fish.

With prepositions you repeat the preposition.

*mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen* – I make the house using sticks and stones.

## Loaned Adjectives

Toki Pona does not use proper nouns, but rather proper adjectives:

*jan Sonja* – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja

*toki Tosi* – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German

*ma Mewika li suli* – The US is big.

Loaned adjectives must follow Toki Pona’s phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(N) syllable structure. The C can only be one consonant. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences *wu*, *wo*, *ji*, *ti*, *nm*, and *nn* are disallowed.

## o

You can use *o* before a verb to turn it into a command.

*o kute!* – Listen!

*o pali* – Work, please.

You can use *o* after a subject to address that subject.

*jan Pape o!* – O Pape!

You can have *o* between a subject and predicate to express a wish, desire, request, etc.

*pona o tawa sina* – I wish for goodness to go to you.

*mi o pali* – I should be working.

Or it can also be a contraction of the first two uses.

*soweli Ton o moku* – Eat, Ton.

## Questions

There are two ways to form yes or no questions. The first way is “word *ala* word.”

*sina moku ala moku?* – Are you eating?

To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb *ala*” or “*ala*”.

*moku* – yes

*moku ala* / *ala* – no

You can also append “*anu seme*”.

*sina moku anu seme?* – Are you eating or what?

A common way to answer yes to these kinds of questions is with *lon* (meaning “true” or “affirmative”).

seme can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with *seme*.

*jan seme li toki?* – Who’s talking?

*sina pali e seme?* – What are you making?

## Preverbs

Preverbs go before verbs to modify their meaning.

*mi kama sona* – I come to know.

*waso lili li wile suli* – The small bird wants to be big.

The words that can act as preverbs are *wile*, *kama*, *sona*, *lukin*, *ken*, *awen*, and sometimes *alasa*, *open*, and *pini*.

## Context

*la* can be used to mark the context of a sentence. X *la* Y means “In the context of X, Y.”

*sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona* – When you are by my side, I feel good.

Most prepositional terms can be moved behind a *la*.

*mi lape lon tenpo pimeja*. *tenpo pimeja la mi lape*. – I sleep at night.

*sina seli tan seme*? *tan seme la sina seli*? – Why are you hot?

## Numbers

Combine number words to add them up.

*wan* – 1. *tu* – 2. *luka* – 5. *tu tu* – 4. *luka tu wan* - 8

nanpa can be used to mark ordinals.

*jan nanpa wan li pona* – The first person is good.

**And... that’s it!**
